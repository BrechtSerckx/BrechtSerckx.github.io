        I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Engineering Science at the KU Leuven university, with major Computer Science and minor Electrical Engineering.  
        Subsequently, I obtained my Master's degree in Engineering: Computer Science with option Artificial Intelligence. 
        I took special interest in courses regarding Programming Language Theory and Formal Systems.

        _Eff_ is an experimental functional programming language that considers computational side effects as algebraic operations or effects and captures them with effect handlers.  
        Eff is compiled to OCaml via the internal calculi _ImpEff_ and _ExEff_.
        To make the compiled code run as fast as possible, optimizations were made to ExEff.  
        This Master's thesis maps the optimizations in ExEff, adds some new optimizations, and proposes the preservation of type for the optimizations.
        In addition, the Master's thesis attempts to evaluate the performance of the generated code compared to non-optimized code.

        CentralApp is a startup that takes care of the online presence local businesses.
        We provide a platform that generates a custom website for businesses based on their style preferences and business specifics.
        We make sure that their clients can find them online by improving SEO, and synchronizing the business data with service providers like Google and Facebook.

        Our backend is a distributed system consisting of services written in Haskell and Scala. 
        The Haskell services are built using Servant and Opaleye.
        We make heavy use of AWS services for deployment, message queues and storage.
        The Nix ecosystem is used for building and developing.

        As the second backend developer, I am co-responsible for... _everything_.
