Out of frustration of the non-existing notifications from [recycleapp.be](https://recycleapp.be), I decided to make my own alternative, with blackjack and hookers.  
[Recycle ICS generator](https://recycle.brechtserckx.be) allows you to generate ICS files for waste collections, and more importantly, let your calendar auto-update them for you.  
Use case: I have it configured to display the collections from 2 weeks before until 4 weeks after the current date in my calendar, and to give me reminders for collections.
